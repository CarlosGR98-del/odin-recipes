    <h2>Description</h2>
    Imagine being able to munch as many crunchy snacks as you want while you're binging that show you love and feeling
    great about it! That's the beauty of these homemade baked kale chips. Made by quickly tossing together three simple
    ingredients — fresh kale, olive oil, and flaked sea salt — and baked low and slow for only 20 minutes, these crispy
    kale chips are easy to make, there are no mystery additives, and even fussy eaters snap them up.
